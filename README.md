To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.

The project’s success will be based on:
● A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without
necessitating additional resources
● Minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states (a state can be considered
understaffed if the staff-to-patient ratio is lower than 90% of the required ratio and overstaffed
if greater than 110%)
